Lingua::JA::Sort::JIS

This Perl module compares and sorts a list of UTF-8 strings
using JIS X 4061, "the collation of Japanese character strings".

To build the module, unpack this distribution somewhere, create
the Makefile by running 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make', 'make
test', and if successful 'make install'.
